# dependency-demo

In this repo I store some demo cases and helper scripts to use with [Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/).

## Angular Projects

* projects are created with `ng new`
* `cyclonedx-bom` is used to generate a SBOM for the new project

## Spring Boot Projects

* Spring Boot projects are created using the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).

## Links

* "A ridiculously bloated non-functional project designed to produce a large number of dependencies":
  [package.json](https://gist.github.com/stevespringett/4d3c39aceb48d9487f644c85845dfe6c)

## Thanks

I want to thank Steve Springett and the community for the work on [Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/)
and [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/).
