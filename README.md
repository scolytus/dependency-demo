# dependency-demo

In this repo I store some demo cases and helper scripts to use with [Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/).

## Angular Projects

* projects are created with `ng new`
* `cyclonedx-bom` is used to generate a SBOM for the new project

## Thanks

I want to thank Steve Springett and the community for the work on Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/)
and [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/).
